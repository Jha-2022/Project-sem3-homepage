            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and 
                character traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about
                which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education 
                is that the change in the student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical 
                thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, 
                and improve forms of education. The term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. 
                Additionally, it can mean the academic field studying education.</p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There are many types of education. Formal education happens 
        in a complex institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is also structured
        but happens outside the formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through 
        daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels. They include early childhood education, 
        primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, 
        like teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education can also be distinguished by subject, 
        like science education, language education, and physical education.</p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small servicepara3">Education is often divided into types.
        The most common division is between formal, non-formal, and informal education. 
        However, some theorists only distinguish between formal and informal education.
        Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework. Such frameworks 
        have a chronological and hierarchical order. For instance, the modern schooling 
        system has classes based on the student's age and progress, all the way from primary 
        school to university. Formal education is usually controlled and guided by the government.
        It is normally compulsory up to a certain age.</p>
